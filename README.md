# HTMLOnlyNim
This is a pure HTML implementation of Nim. 

I use python script to mass produce almost all files for the folder [p1](p1.tar.gz) and [p2](p2.tar.gz). (`p1/0_0_0.html` and `p2/0_0_0.html` has be edited after the script produced them.) If you want to run this program, you would need to uncompass these two files. and put the them in the same directory of [index.html](index.html)
