# HTMLOnlyNim
This is a pure HTML implementation of Nim. I use python script to mass produce all but 2 files for the folder [p1](p1.tar.gz) and [p2](p2.tar.gz). 

If you want to run this program, you would need to uncompass these two .tag.gz files. and put the them in the same directory of [index.html](index.html)
