# HTMLOnlyNim
This is a pure HTML implementation of Nim. 

I use python script to mass produce almost all files for the folder [p1](p1) and [p2](p2). (The script does not produce `p1/0_0_0.html` and `p2/0_0_0.html`.) If you want to run this program, using the zip from master, you need to the script.
